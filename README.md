# Re-analysis of Asic et al. 2024 Science TCR-enriched scRNA data
This repository explores the TCR-enriched scRNA sequencing data, originally published in [Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adn9083). 

The TCR (T cell Receptor) is specific for T lymphocytes, with enrichment before scRNA-seq increasing both purity and depth, enabling the identification of more rare clones.
